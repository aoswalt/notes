# Unix Shell

A Unix shell is the combination of user interface, command language, and scripting language used by the operating system to control the system itself.

Shells come in varying flavors of syntax and capabilities. For example, [zsh](ru1t8_z-shell-zsh-for-short.md) and [bash](rlstd_bourne-again-shell-bash-for-short.md) are 2 of the most common shells, and while have many similar aspects, they diverge in ways that may or may not be relevant to a user. Many of the features that we know of today can be directly traced back to the [Bourne shell](pk56a_bourne-shell.md).

The term _shell_ may sometimes be used in some more general contexts to refer to a general interface to enter commands.
