# Bourne Again Shell (bash for short)

Serving as an open-source replacement of the [Bourne Shell](pk56a_bourne-shell.md), bash has been the default [shell](dpxbb_unix-shell.md) for users on most Linux distributions, leading to it being the de-facto scripting language for servers. While POSIX-compliant, it provides further extensions for more functionality and flexibility.

The ubiquity of bash leads to a fair bit of confusion about what is "standard" for shell scripting.
