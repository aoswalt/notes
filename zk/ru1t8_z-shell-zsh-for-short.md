# Z-Shell (zsh for short)

For the majority of users, zsh supplants [bash](rlstd_bourne-again-shell-bash-for-short.md) as the go-to [shell](dpxbb_unix-shell.md) with it being very similar to bash in most regards with often the differences being more convenient for users. Most bash scripting works the same for zsh even beyond POSIX-compliance unlike a shall like fish that opts for syntax that varies more but has more user-friendly features out of the box.
