Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a method of note management focused on learning and thinking.

The method focuses on a few key aspects for each individual "Zettel":

* Zettels should be atomic in nature, consisting of only a single thought each.
* Zettels should be written to describe WHY the information is important
* Zettels should link to other knowledge points to form networks of knowledge

By adding tags to notes and linking to related notes, an entire network of knowledge is produced over time.

The [Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) explains a foundational "why" and "how" about the method with the specifics of the implementation left up to individual person.

## Tags

Tags should describe [objects not topics](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/) to be able to get only the notes specifically applicable to the tag and not broadly related.

> Only tags that are specific to the objects I use and mention in a note are worthy

As a specific example

> it doesn't make sense to put `python` anywhere I talk about the language. Or say I come up with an algorithm to illustrate something, and the algorithm is written in Python -- I wouldn't tag the note with `python` at all, since it's not a note about Python. When I compare code snippets in 5 different languages, I apply tags for all 5 languages
