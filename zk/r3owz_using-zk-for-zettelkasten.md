# Using zk for Zettelkasten

The [zk](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk) command-line program provides tooling around using markdown notes in the [Zettelkasten](90vq8_zettelkasten.md) method. The [zk-nvim](https://github.com/mickael-menu/zk-nvim) plugin interfaces [neovim]() with zk to provide [lsp](711g4_language-server-protocol.md) integration and other supporting features inside of neovim.

The combination of zk and its corresponding neovim plugin makes writing tool-agnostic Zettels easy with features that rival special-built applications.
