# Bourne Shell (sh for short)

Introduced in 1979, the Bourne shell became the standard [shell](dpxbb_unix-shell.md) for version 7 of Unix. Its initial version established many of the foundational shell features that are used today, including scripting, [interactive vs non-interactive](i5k65_interactive-and-login-shells.md), and environment variables just to mention a few.
